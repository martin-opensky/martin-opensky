### Hi there 👋
I am a senior software engineer with 15 years of experience across the full development stack, primarily working with TypeScript and PHP. In recent years, I have focused my software development on the front-end, working with React and Next.js, and I enjoy crafting responsive user interfaces that are both intuitive and visually appealing. 

Alongside my development work, I have also fulfilled management roles that have involved leading small start-up teams, attending board meetings, and working directly with the CEO of start-up companies.

Recently, I've been building tools that accelerate decentralisation and human sovereignty.

Notable projects include Whisper Assistant, a VS Code extension that allows developers to write code using their voice, and previously, Embrace Community, an app that empowered creatives to connect with their community using decentralised technologies.

If you'd like to collaborate or learn more about my work, feel free to reach out!
