### Hi there 👋
I'm a software engineer based near London, UK and I work on projects that help make the world a better place to live.

I've worked in the industry for over 15 years, collaborating with companies across many industries. Currently, I'm building tools that accelerate decentralisation and human sovereignty.

Notable projects include Whisper Assistant, a VS Code extension that allows developers to write code using their voice, and previously, Embrace Community, an app that empowered creatives to connect with their community using decentralised technologies.

If you'd like to collaborate or learn more about my work, feel free to reach out!
