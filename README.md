### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in the UK close to London and I work on projects that help make the world a better place to live.

I've worked in the industry for over 15 years collaborating with companies across many industries and I'm building tools that accelerate decentralisation and human sovereignty.

Currently I'm working on Whisper Assistant, a Cursor extension that allows developers to write code using their voice, and Scholarly, an app that empowers independant investigation and research for journalists and anyone who wishes to understand how our world works.

If you want to work together, feel free to reach out to me.
