### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software engineer based near London, UK and I work on projects that help make the world a better place to live.

I've worked in the industry for over 15 years, collaborating with companies across many industries. Currently, I'm building tools that accelerate decentralisation and human sovereignty.

My current projects include Whisper Assistant, a Cursor extension that allows developers to write code using their voice, and Scholarly, an app that empowers independent investigation and research for journalists and anyone seeking to understand how our world works.

If you'd like to collaborate or learn more about my work, feel free to reach out!
